# Handwritten-digit-recognition-through-ANN-KERAS-

Applying concepts of deep learning to classify MNIST hand written digit data set by using ANN.Artificial Neural Network its is a supervised learning technique ,in which a network of neurons are used .

Input data is feed forward (forward propogation) and Errors are computed and it is backpropogated(Backpropogation) through every hidden layer. 

## Dependency used:-

  2.Pandas
  
  3.Matplotlib
  
  4.Tensorflow
  
  5.Keras
